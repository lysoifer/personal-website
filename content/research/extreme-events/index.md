Species range shifts are generally evaluated relative to changes in average climate conditions over time. However, the impact of extreme weather and climate events (EWCEs) on range dynamics is not well understand. Given that EWCEs are increasing in magnitude and frequency, it is important to understand how they impacting the reorganization of biodiversity. In this perspective, we posit that EWCEs are causing rapidly fluctuating range edges rather than consistent expansion or contraction. However, impacts will be mediated by exposure to severe weather conditions.
